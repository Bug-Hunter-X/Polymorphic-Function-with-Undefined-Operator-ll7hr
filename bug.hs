This Haskell code attempts to use a polymorphic function with an undefined type variable.  The function `mysteryFunction` is defined to work with any type `a`, but it tries to use the `>` operator, which is not defined for all types.  This will result in a compile-time error if you try to apply this function to a type without a defined `>` operator, such as String. 

```haskell
mysteryFunction :: a -> a -> Bool
mysteryFunction x y = x > y
```
