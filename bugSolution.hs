The solution is to constrain the type variable `a` to belong to the `Ord` typeclass. This ensures that the `>` operator is defined for the type.

```haskell
mysteryFunction :: Ord a => a -> a -> Bool
mysteryFunction x y = x > y

main :: IO ()
main = do
  print (mysteryFunction 5 3) -- Works
  print (mysteryFunction 3 5) -- Works
  --print (mysteryFunction "hello" "world") -- This will still fail because String has different >
```
By adding the `Ord a =>` constraint, we specify that `mysteryFunction` can only be used with types that are members of the `Ord` typeclass, which provides an ordering (e.g., `Int`, `Double`, types with derived `Ord` instances). This eliminates the compile-time error.
